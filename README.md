>Another MML inspired audio programming language but highly flexible!

It will feature a custom golfing language **of your choice**. You choose what notes are in your octave, what tuning you want... So it should support any weird music tuning system!
The interpreter will be written in Python, but the score and settings will be kept as plain text and very permissive. Everything should already be made in the settings and the interpreter so that you can write freely and with ease a textual score that feels very familiar.  
The sound will be made and tweaked in Python using Numpy and Pygame ; 
I also want the sound design to be made on Pure-Data and will do something to link the two together with MIDI events in another less flexible version.  

This project is frozen right now. One day!
